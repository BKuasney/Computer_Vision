# PyTorch Installation Guide  


This is a documentation on how to install the latest version of pytorch on Rapberry Pi.
This instructions should work on any Raspbery Pi version. [This guide is still under edit,use with caution]

## Pre-Installation

It is recommended to use a 16 GB or 32 GB SD card and load the latest version of the [Raspian OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/).

Before starting the installation, update and upgrade the OS and ensure that there is a text editor 
install(vim,nano,gedit or other text editor). For this guide, we will be using nano.(nano should be 
pre-installed in the OS)
```shell
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
```

## Add SWAP memory

To prevent any occurance of ‘Memory exhausted’ or ‘Cannot Allocate Memory’, we would need to increase the swap memory.
```shell
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swap1 bs=1M count=2048
sudo mkswap /swap1
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```
This will open up the fstab file. You may or may not have a swap file. If you see a line of code like,
```shell
/swap0 swap swap
```
You already had a swap. Replace that line with the line of code below. If you dont, add the line of code below.
```shell
/swap1 swap swap
```

Reboot your machine so that raspberry pi recognize the new swap space
```shell
sudo reboot now
```

## Dependencies

Install libraries.  
```shell
sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev libblas-dev m4 cmake cython python3-dev python3-yaml python3-setuptools
pip3 install --user pyyaml numpy wheel
```

For this installation, we would be using Python 3 as the Pytorch developer recommends to do so. (There is currently some problems that are encountered using Python 2)

## PyTorch installation

Follow the steps below. Bare in mind that the installation takes a few hours when running the 'setup.py' script.

```shell
mkdir pytorch_install && cd pytorch_install
git clone --recursive https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch
cd pytorch
export NO_CUDA=1
export NO_DISTRIBUTED=1
export NO_MKLDNN=1 
export NO_NNPACK=1
export NO_QNNPACK=1
python3 setup.py build && python3 setup.py bdist_wheel
cd dist
ls
pip3 install --user torch-1.1.0a0+dfcafb1-cp35-cp35m-linux_armv7l.whl
cd ..
sudo -E python3 setup.py install
```
In case you want to reinstall, make sure that you uninstall PyTorch first by running ```pip3 uninstall torch``` and ```python3 setup.py clean```

## Check

Once the installation is complete, check if the installation is successful by checking the Pytorch version.

```shell
cd ~ && python3
import torch
print(torch.__version__)
```

If you get something like ```1.1.0a0+dfcafb1```, your installation is successful.
