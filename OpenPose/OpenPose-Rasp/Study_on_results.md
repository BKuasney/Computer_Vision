# Study on our Results: Estimated FPS and Actual FPS  

Here, we will study our experiment results whether those are reasonable based on theory and calculation.  


## Environment  

Author's environment:
>ARM.
> A Qualcomm Snapdragon 810. We use a highly-optimized Neon-based
> implementation. A single thread is used for evaluation.
([ShuffleNet V2: Practical Guidelines for Efficient
CNN Architecture Design](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.11164.pdf) p.3)  

Author uses Qualcomm Snapdragon 810. Therefore, we estimated their GFLOPS as around 300 from below webpage.  
> 324~388.8GFLOPS  
(https://gpuflops.blogspot.com/2015/02/gpu-flops-list.html?m=1)  


My environment([source](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/))ã€€:
>  A 900MHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 CPU  
>  1GB RAM

We checked Pi FLOPs using ```lscpu```.

At Flags, you can see neon is activated.  
From above, we calculated our Pi GFLOPS as follows.  

> Raspberry Pi 2 	Cortex-A7 	4.8 GFLOPS 	0.6GHz 	4 	8 	NEON: 2(mad) x1(simd) x4(core) x0.6(clock) = 4.8 GFLOPS  
(I referred here https://dench.flatlib.jp/opengl/cpuflops to derive estimation.)

## Comparison  

1.0 Shufflenet V2:  
From [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.11164.pdf), I will calculate estimated FPS.  
24.4x(4.8GFLOPS/324GFLOPS)=0.36  

The estimated FPS is 0.36.  
However, this is just a third of actual FPS(1.09).  


1.0 Mobilenet V2:  
8.9x(4.8GFLOPS/324GFLOPS)=0.13  

However, observed result is 0.66  
This is a fifth of it.  

We are trying to find this reason.
